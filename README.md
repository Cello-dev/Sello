# Sello
Mobile application that allows users and businesses to connect with each other and add products, track sales, and pay out commission for each sale.

## Requirements
When setting up the project locally, there are a few steps required to get the project up and running:
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Good text editor to develop JavaScript projects
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads): Version control system designed to keep track of code changes in the project
* [NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/): Package manager that installs dependencies
* [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/): Command-line interface that runs and builds the project
* [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client):  Mobile app that displays how the project looks on the device

Once those are installed, then you should be able to run the project without much of a problem. You will have to do a bit of work trying to set up NPM and Expo CLI depending on your operating system.

## Jira
This project uses Jira for issue tracking and agile project management. The style used is Kanban, which allows developers to make small incremental changes and continuously improve the product.
